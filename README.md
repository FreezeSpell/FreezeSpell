Hiya!

My name is Bernd. I'm currently a student of Cognitive Science & Artificial Intelligence @ Tilburg University. I mostly use this Github for school and private purposes. I mess around with machine learning, but am still learning the very basics. Besides technicals, I enjoy photography, video games, am very much a how-does-this-work kind of person, and possess a weirdly high number of random factoids.

I am oftentimes extremely confused by Git and GitHub mechanics, so my repos might not always be completely organised.
