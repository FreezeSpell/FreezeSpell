Hiya!

My name is Bernd. I'm currently a student of Cognitive Science & Artificial Intelligence @ Tilburg University. I mostly use this Github for school and private purposes.  
My fields of interest:  
  - Machine Learning  
  - Webdesign  
  - Automation  
  - Game modding

Some of my current ongoing projects:  
  - #special-octo-barnacle --> A Kickstarter Scraper for analyzing campaigns.    
  - #buitengewoon-thuis --> A poor man's remodeling of a website.
  - #OlivierBroekman/rust-raid-cost-calculator --> A web app for Rust (the game) tools
  
Besides technicals, I enjoy photography, video games, am very much a how-does-this-work kind of person, and possess a weirdly high number of random facts.
