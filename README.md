Hiya!

My name is Bernd. I'm currently a BSc. (Hons.) Student of Cognitive Science & Artificial Intelligence @ Tilburg University. I develop both in my free time and for school.
My fields of interest include:  
  - Machine Learning  
  - Webdesign  
  - Automation   
  - Game modding
<br>  
<h2>Ongoing</h2>  
Between all the projects that I did just to dabble in a certain field, I am currently working on a couple of main projects:  
<br>
     
 &nbsp; &nbsp; [~/OlivierBroekman/rust-raid-cost-calculator](https://github.com/OlivierBroekman/rust-raid-cost-calculator) -> A website with tools for the game Rust <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; [~/rust-rrcc-deploy](https://github.com/FreezeSpell/rust-rrcc-deploy) -> The active deployment fork of above repo
 &nbsp; &nbsp;

Besides technicals, I enjoy photography, video games, and am very much a how-does-this-work kind of person. Check out my photography work at @bernd.jpeg on Instagram!
